# These are the version numbers for the package manager.
# If VERSION is the same as RELEASE_VERSION then the current build
# will be copied into the Release directory on the server. This will
# release the game.
# If the VERSION is different to the RELEASE_VERSION then nothing will
# be copied.
# If VERSION and RELEASE_VERSION are 0.0.0 (defaults) then nothing
# will be copied.
# If RELEASE_VERSION is greater than VERSION then nothing will be copied.
#
# This version number must also be the same as the version number in
# your packaged JAR file created by running "gradle jar". This file is
# located at:
# deco2800.arcade.GAME/build/libs/deco2800.arcade.GAME-VERSION.jar
