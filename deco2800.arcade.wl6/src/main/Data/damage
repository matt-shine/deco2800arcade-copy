The primary decisive factor is that of two random numbers, each of which is between, and including, 0 and 255

Playing on “Can I play, Daddy?” difficulty divides all damage you take by four.

SS guards and Bosses are considered better shots in the game, so for any calculations the distance used for calculating hit or damage is reduced by one third

The further away you are, the lesser chance of the enemy hitting you, and the less damage you will take. This only applies to hitscans.

If the player is running, the enemy’s chance of hitting you is reduced. This only applies to hitscans.

If you can see the enemy shooting at you, you have half as much chance of being hit as if they are shooting you from out of the player’s view. This only applies to hitscans.



[DIST]
    Distance between enemy and player (in number of squares).
[SPEED]
    160 (if player is running) or 256 (if player isn't).
[LOOK]
    16 (if player can see the shooter) or 8 (if the player can’t).
[RAND1]
    A random number between 0 and 255 (inclusive). Used for hit calculation.
[RAND2]
    A second random number between 0 and 255 (inclusive). Used for damage calculation.


Hitscans are the game's method of calculating bullets. There are two calculations for hitscans: one to determine if the player is hit, followed by one to determine how much damage is dealt.

The Formula to calculate a hit is:

If shooter is SS or Boss then: [DIST] = [DIST] x (2 / 3)

Player is considered hit if: [RAND1] < ( [SPEED] - ( [DIST] x [LOOK] ) )


If the player is hit then the second calculation is performed to determine how much damage the player will take. The Formula to calculate damage is:

If shooter is SS or Boss then: [DIST] = [DIST] x (2 / 3)

If ( [DIST] less than 2 ) then damage is: [RAND2] / 4

If ( [DIST] between 2 and 4 ) then damage is: [RAND2] / 8

If ( [DIST] is 4 or more ) then damage is: [RAND2] / 16

If “Can I play daddy” then [DAMAGE] = [DAMAGE] / 4


Dogs can only attack when the player is in the adjacent square using the following formula:

Player is bitten if [RAND1] < 180

Damage taken = [RAND2] / 16


Many characters shoot projectiles, including Fake Hitlers, Dr Schabbs, General Fettgesicht and Otto Giftmacher .

The player can dodge these projectiles so no calculation is done to determine hit chance, only damage:

Needle damage = ( [RAND2] / 8 ) + 20

Rocket damage = ( [RAND2] / 8 ) + 30

Fireball damage = ( [RAND2] / 8 )


Ghosts and Spectres only do damage upon contact with the player:

Damage = 10



The formula used to determine the damage given to an enemy by the player is as follows:
Knife

[DAMAGE] = [RAND2] / 16

Gun

If ( [DIST] is 4 or more ) then only hit if ( ( [RAND1] / 12 ) < [DIST] ).

If ( [DIST] is less than 2 ) then [DAMAGE] = [RAND2] / 4

If ( [DIST] is 2 or more ) then [DAMAGE] = [RAND2] / 6
